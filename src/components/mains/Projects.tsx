            <p>
                Citryss is a multi-tenant "operator OS" for hospitality groups and their B2B arms. It pairs fully custom Next.js
                websites with a single, role-based admin dashboard where owners and managers can edit menus, publish events, and manage
                first-party reservations across multiple venuesâ€”no per-cover marketplace fees, full data ownership. The same dashboard
                also powers a wholesale portal (license verification, editable catalog, orders, customer records), so restaurants and a
                liquor/distributor business can run under one login. Under the hood it's a Django/DRF + PostgreSQL platform with RBAC,
                API keys, tests, and documented APIs designed for speed, reliability, and easy iteration.
